abstract = {The practical advantages of Bayesian inference are demonstrated through two concrete examples. In the first example, we wish to learn about a crimi-nal's IQ: a problem of parameter estimation. In the second example, we wish to quantify support in favor of a null hypothesis, and track this support as the data accumulate: a problem of hypothesis testing. The Bayesian frame-work unifies both problems within a coherent predictive framework, where parameters and models that predict the data successfully will receive a boost in plausibility, whereas parameters and models that predict poorly suffer a decline. Our examples demonstrate how Bayesian analyses can be more in-formative, more elegant, and more flexible than the orthodox methodology that remains dominant within the field of psychology. On a sunny morning in Florida, while the birds were singing and the crickets chirping, Bob decided to throw his wife from the bedroom balcony, killing her instantly. The case is},

@article{Morey2015:fallacy,
abstract = {Interval estimates - estimates of parameters that include an allowance for sampling uncertainty - have long been touted as a key component of statistical analyses. There are several kinds of interval estimates, but the most popular are confidence intervals (CIs): intervals that contain the true parameter value in some known proportion of repeated samples, on average. The width of confidence intervals is thought to index the precision of an estimate; CIs are thought to be a guide to which parameter values are plausible or reasonable; and the confidence coefficient of the interval (e.g., 95 {\%}) is thought to index the plausibility that the true parameter is included in the interval. We show in a number of examples that CIs do not necessarily have any of these properties, and can lead to unjustified or arbitrary inferences. For this reason, we caution against relying upon confidence interval theory to justify interval estimates, and suggest that other theories of interval estimation should be used instead.},
